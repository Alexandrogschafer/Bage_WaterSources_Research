#  Sustainable Management of Potable Water Sources in Bagé-RS through Geospatial Technologies

# Abstract
The general objective of this research is to explore, apply, and evaluate products, techniques, and procedures within the context of geospatial technology (Geoinformatics, Geographic Information Science, Spatial Data Science, and Geospatial Artificial Intelligence) to create a comprehensive data repository on the physical, environmental, and land use and land cover aspects of the contribution basin of water sources intended for urban supply in Bagé.

The methodology employed encompasses several stages, beginning with the survey and compilation of existing studies to base the project on prior knowledge. Next, a Geospatial Information and Content Management System (GICMS) will be developed to integrate and manage the collected data. The project also includes the delimitation of the contribution basin of the water sources, identification of the drainage network, geomorphometric analysis, mapping of the road system and land tenure structure, and monitoring of the water surface of the dams.

Additionally, the project will conduct detailed mappings of land use and land cover dynamics, vegetation studies, climatological data analysis, determination of critical sections for environmental impacts, and estimates of the effects of climate change.

It is expected that by the end of the project, a robust database and analytical tools will be available, significantly contributing to the sustainable management of water resources. This will promote more efficient and responsible land use and environmental conservation practices within the coverage area of the Arvorezinha-Bagé-RS dam contribution basin.
